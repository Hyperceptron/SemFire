"""
Rule-based and LLM-enhanced detector for Echo Chamber attack cues and deceptive reasoning.
This module provides tools to identify potential deceptive reasoning and
context manipulation cues in text, forming a basis for detecting multi-turn
attacks like "Echo Chamber" which leverage context poisoning and semantic steering.
It now incorporates a local LLM for deeper analysis.
