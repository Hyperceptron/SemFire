# Limitations and Failure Modes Report

**Date:** October 3, 2025
**Phase:** 6 - Testing, Evaluation & Robustness

---

## Overview
This report documents the limitations and potential failure modes of the AEGIS system, based on analysis of its test coverage, observed behaviors, and code review. Each identified issue includes a description, impact, and recommended mitigation strategies.

## Limitations & Failure Modes

### 1. Limited Adversarial and Fuzzing Coverage
**Description:** Automated fuzzing and randomized adversarial input generation are not present in the current test suite.
**Impact:** Unseen edge cases or malformed inputs may bypass detection or cause unexpected behavior.
**Mitigation:** Integrate fuzzing tools (e.g., Hypothesis for Python) and expand adversarial test cases to cover more input permutations.

### 2. Skipped UI Tests Due to Dependency Issues
**Description:** Demo UI tests are skipped due to missing `pytest-streamlit` dependency.
**Impact:** UI robustness, error handling, and user experience under edge cases are not validated.
**Mitigation:** Resolve dependency issues and enable UI tests to ensure coverage for user-facing failures.

### 3. Out-of-Memory or High Latency Under Load
**Description:** No stress or performance tests are present for batch processing, concurrent requests, or large input sizes.
**Impact:** The system may experience high latency, timeouts, or out-of-memory errors under heavy load.
**Mitigation:** Add stress tests and benchmarks for latency and memory usage. Implement resource limits and optimize memory management.

### 4. Detector Initialization and API Error Handling
**Description:** API test suite covers detector initialization failures only for EchoChamberDetector.
**Impact:** If other detectors fail to initialize, errors may not be handled gracefully.
**Mitigation:** Standardize error handling for all detectors and add tests for initialization failures across the system.

### 5. Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization
**Description:** Limited evidence of input validation for malformed or unexpected data types.
**Impact:** Malformed inputs could cause exceptions or undefined behavior.
**Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation and add tests for invalid input types and formats.

### 6. No Explicit Resource Exhaustion or Timeout Handling
**Description:** The system does not appear to handle resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) or timeouts explicitly.
**Impact:** Under resource exhaustion, the system may crash or hang.
**Mitigation:** Add timeout and resource limit checks, and test for graceful degradation under exhaustion scenarios.

### 7. Limited Coverage for Multi-Turn and Contextual Attacks
**Description:** Coverage for multi-turn adversarial attacks is limited.
**Impact:** Sophisticated attacks leveraging context may evade detection.
**Mitigation:** Expand tests to cover multi-turn and context-aware adversarial scenarios.

## Recommendations
- Integrate fuzzing and adversarial input generation into the test suite.
- Enable and expand UI tests for robustness validation.
- Add stress and performance benchmarks for latency and memory usage.
- Standardize error handling and initialization checks for all detectors.
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
- Add resource exhaustion and timeout handling mechanisms.
- Expand multi-turn and contextual adversarial test coverage.
